# Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This repository contains code for predicting laptop prices using both traditional machine learning (Linear Regression) and deep learning (Neural Networks) approaches. The dataset used for this project is `amazon_laptop_prices_v01.csv`.

## Overview

- The project starts with data preprocessing and feature engineering using Python libraries like Pandas and Scikit-Learn.
- Categorical features in the dataset are label encoded to convert them into numerical values.
- Missing values in the 'rating' column are filled with the mean rating.
- The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`, and feature scaling is performed using `MinMaxScaler`.
- Linear Regression is applied as the first machine learning model to predict laptop prices.
- A neural network model is built using Keras with TensorFlow backend to predict laptop prices. The architecture consists of multiple dense layers.
- Early stopping is used during training to prevent overfitting and restore the best weights.
- The training and validation results are visualized using scatter plots and a 45-degree line to assess model performance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Keras (with TensorFlow backend)

## Running the Code

1. Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed in your Python environment.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code files.

3. Place your dataset as `amazon_laptop_prices_v01.csv` in the same directory as the code files.

4. Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to run the code. You can follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the code.

## Results

- The Linear Regression model's performance can be assessed using the R-squared score.
- The neural network model's performance can be observed through scatter plots and the validation loss graph.

## Issues and Enhancements

- If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
